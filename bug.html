This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature. However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too visually similar, the gradient might appear as a solid color, especially on some browsers or devices with lower color depth settings.  The problem isn't a Tailwind bug per se but rather a limitation of how gradients are rendered.
